# Interactive comments section

Your challenge is to build out this interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content on the first load.

Your users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments

### Expected behaviour

- First-level comments should be ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` object from within the `data.json` file.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.

## Where to find everything

Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/LuJ7zGmrT3jVvYeo6Ce92S/interactive-comments-section-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
